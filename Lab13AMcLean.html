<details><summary>Information on the Castle of Good Hope</summary>
<p>This famous castle was erected by the Dutch East India 
Company in 1666 and is the oldest colonial structure in South Africa. During the Second Boer War, 
prisoners were kept within the confines in refitted jail cells. The cells were never removed, 
and the poor conditions can still be seen today. The Castle of Good Hope is currently home to the Castle Military Museum.</P>

<details><summary>Information on the Saladin Citadel</summary>
<p>Construction on the walls of the Saladin Citadel began as far back as 1176. 
It was built to fortify Cairo from invasions during the Crusades. Over the centuries various features 
were added, such as the minarets designed in the Ottoman style of the 19th century. The Citadel is 
currently a historic site and houses several museums.</p>

<details><summary>Information on the Yohannes Castle</summary>
<p>Located in Gondar, which once served as the capital of the Ethiopian Empire, 
Yohannes Castle was built in the 17th century for Emperor Yohannes I. 
It is said to be as great as the palace of King Solomon.</p>

<h2 style = "color:orange">Great Zimbabwe</h2>
<div id = "g"><img src = "greatz.jpg" alt = "castle4" height = "200" width = "450"></div>
<details><summary>Information on the Great Zimbabwe</summary>
<p>Once housing the capital of the Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe (11th to 13th centuries), 
the ruins of Great Zimbabwe constitute the largest stone structure in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Amazingly, these giant walls were all built without mortar. Similar sites are scattered 
across this region of Africa, but Great Zimbabwe is the largest and remains the most 
impressive to this day, truly deserving of its nomenclature.</p>
