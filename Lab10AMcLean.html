<p style = "background-color:white;border:10px solid red;font-size:1em"><em>Japan</em> , a country located in the North Pacific off the coast of Russia and the Korean peninsula, is known to be
one of the most technological countries of its time. This island consists of four main islands known as Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu,
and densely populated cities that attracts tourists from different countries around the world. In fact, Japan is known to be active with over 1,500 volcanoes per year.
Another interesting fact about this small island, is that it has an overall population of over 127,000,000 and the two main religions they worship are Shinto and Buddhism along with
a small percentage worshipping Christianity. The official language is Japanese, but in the Japanese education system
, reading and writing in English is <b>mandatory</b>. In fact, the Japanese uses four different writing systems:Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana, and Romaji. This project is going to discuss: <span style = "color:#000080;font-weight:800">Culture, Places to visit, Foods</span>
and other interesting topics.</p>
